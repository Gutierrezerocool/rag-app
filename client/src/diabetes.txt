Title: Understanding Type 2 Diabetes

Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body processes blood sugar (glucose). Unlike people with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 diabetes produce insulin; however, the insulin their pancreas secretes is either not enough or the body doesn't recognize and use it efficiently.

### Common Symptoms:
- Increased thirst and frequent urination
- Increased hunger
- Fatigue and blurred vision
- Slow-healing sores or frequent infections
- Areas of darkened skin, usually in the armpits and neck

### Causes:
Type 2 diabetes is primarily caused by:
- Obesity and physical inactivity
- Genetics and family history
- Insulin resistance

### Management:
Managing type 2 diabetes includes:
- Healthy eating
- Regular exercise
- Monitoring blood sugar levels
- Oral medications or insulin therapy
- Managing stress

### Complications:
If not managed properly, diabetes can lead to:
- Cardiovascular disease
- Nerve damage (neuropathy)
- Kidney damage
- Eye damage
- Foot problems

### Prevention:
You can reduce your risk of type 2 diabetes through:
